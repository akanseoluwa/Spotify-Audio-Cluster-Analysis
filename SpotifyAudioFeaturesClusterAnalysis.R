# Task # 
# - Complete a cluster analysis of the Spotify audio features data 

# Experience
# - Unsupervised Learning

# Performance Measure
# - Internal Validation : Calinski Harabasz Index
#                       : Silhouete
# - External Validation : - Rand Index


# Reading Spotify Songs data

# Scaling our dataset

# Visualising our data

## INTERNAL VALIDATION #

# Calling cluster library for Silhouette

# Calculating the dissimilarity matrix

### REPORT ###
### MOTIVATION and COMMENTS ### 


# From the CH index, there is an elbow at k =2 and from 2 downwards there is a downward movement on the graph
# till it  fades off. From this , I will suggest a 
# two cluster solution. 

# From the Silhouette , the two cluster solution has a greater Silhouette number than that
# of the 3 cluster solution. So I will suggest a two cluster solution
# from the Silhouette Index.
#
# From the Visulaisation of the plots of the two and three clusters, 
# the plot of the two clusters seems to be more clear and pass more
#information than that of the three clusters. I will also suggest a two
# cluster solution from the visualisations.
#
# From the Rand Index, Most of our data in cluster 1 belong to the acoustic genre with 
# little representation of the pop and rock genre while 
# most of our data in Cluster two belong to the pop genre, followed by the rock genre and
# little representation of the acoustic genre.

# The Rand Index gives a value of 0.73 which is quite large
# and the adjusted Rand Index gives a value of 0.47 which is okay and
# still suggests a fairly good fit.
